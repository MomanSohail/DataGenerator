- data generation
- data encoder
- training 
- neural planner
- dataset
- configuration
- models
## modules explanation
> # models
> * model contains trained and encoded binary files.
> * this model has 2 folder 1. encoders 2. models
> * encoders have 2 directories 1. 2D 2. 3D
> * 2D folder has 2D encoder weights 
> * 3D has 3D encoder weights
> * similarly, models folder has 2 folders where store the training weights of 2D and 3D
